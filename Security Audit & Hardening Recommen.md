Hello there,



During a security review of target website, I identified several critical and high-risk vulnerabilities related to the web server configuration and the deployment of the application. These issues if left unaddressed, expose the server to automated attacks, data interception, and various client-side exploits.



This report details the findings their associated risks, and a prioritized plan for remediation.



**Summary of Findings:**



1. critical >   Publicly Exposed application > Full server compromise, data exposure, pivot to internal networks.
2. High >	Missing HTTP Security Headers > Vulnerability to XSS clickjacking, and browser-level attacks.

3\. High >	No Forced HTTPS > Susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, session hijacking.

4\. Medium >	Weak TLS Versions \& Ciphers > Traffic may be vulnerable to decryption via known exploits (POODLE, BEAST).

5\. Low > 	Server Version Information Leakage > 	Aids attackers in finding version-specific exploits (CVEs).



**Detailed Findings \& Recommendations:**

***1. Critical Risk: Publicly Exposed Vulnerable Application >>***

**Finding**: The primary application bWAPP, is insecure. It contains over 100 known vulnerabilities covering the entire OWASP Top 10.

**Risk**: If this instance is reachable by the public internet, it's not a matter of if it will be compromised, but when. Automated scanners will quickly find and exploit its weaknesses, leading to full server compromise, database exfiltration, credential theft, and use of the server to host malicious payloads.

**Recommendation**: Immediately restrict access to the running bWAPP instance. It should never be exposed publicly. Place it behind a VPN or use a strict IP allowlist so that it's only accessible on a trusted network.



***2. High Risk: Missing or Weak HTTP Security Headers >>***

**Finding**: The server is missing crucial security headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security. This results in a poor grade on securityheaders.com.

**Risk**: This significantly weakens the browsers built-in defenses against common attacks like XSS, clickjacking, and MIME-type sniffing, making users vulnerable.

**Recommendation**: Implement a strong baseline of security headers at the web server level.



**3. *High Risk: Lack of HTTPS Enforcement >>***

**Finding**: The site responds over HTTP and does not automatically redirect to HTTPS. The Strict-Transport-Security header is also missing.

**Risk**: Unencrypted traffic can be easily intercepted and modified in a Man-in-the-Middle attack, exposing user credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data. HSTS is necessary to prevent downgrade attacks.

**Recommendation:** Enforce a server-wide 301 redirect from HTTP to HTTPS and deploy the HSTS header once all subdomains are confirmed to support HTTPS.



***4. Medium Risk: Weak TLS Protocols \& Cipher Suites >>***

**Finding**: The server may be configured to support outdated protocols (TLS 1.0, 1.1) and weak cipher suites. An SSL Labs Scan will confirm the exact configuration.

**Risk**: Old TLS versions are vulnerable to known attacks like POODLE and BEAST. Using weak ciphers reduces the confidentiality of the encrypted traffic.

**Recommendation**: Disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Configure the server to support only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 with modern, secure cipher suites. Aim for an "A" or "A+" grade on SSL Labs.
